- Enable communication between different parts of the system

### 3.4 Content Providers
**Definition**: Manage shared application data

**Purpose**:
- Provide standardized interface for data access

## 4. Android File System

### 4.1 Directory Structure
```
/system          - System files and applications
/data            - User data and applications
